# amfoss-tasks

Hey, I am Mrinalini and I love Coding but of course i'm a noob. I've always been enthusiastic about learning more and more of and about coding and make use of it. In fact, coding is the only reason i decided to get a degree in engineering.

I have been doing some noob level coding since class 4th starting from Logo, then to GW Basic and then BlueJ Java but i was not in touch with for the last one year. I always loved getting a challenge going through the problem in my head and creating a code and always got the happy hormones when the code ran without an error.

When i started doing the tasks i thought that my prior knowledge of coding would give me an advantage but later i realized that coding on BlueJ was different and very much more user friendly i.e. easier than running a code in any other language anywhere else. Anyhow, i started learning, faced some difficulties (technical and non-technical) and decided to do as much as was possible by me.

Loving coding and solving problem questions has been one thing for me but i had never before thought about using coding in some more real places like web designing or open source coding which is what i hope to learn about through amFOSS in the future.

I had created another amfoss tasks repository before this but faced some issues with it so i had delete it and make another and re-upload things.

I have not completed all my tasks but i did as much as i could or found more interesting than others. I tried doing each task but could not complete all of them..
