# Installing Ubuntu

I started by reading about ubuntu & linux since i had not much prior knowledge about it.

Next, i read about how it is different and better than windows os.

I read some blogs on how to install it and also watched some videos.

I decide to double boot windows and ubuntu and watched more videos on how to do the same.

Through the videos and blogs i figured the first thing i needed to do was backup all my data so i did that.

Next thing required was to install Ubuntu from the ubuntu website and to dowload a tool called etcher from the etcher website to make live USB.

Next step was to format a USB of storage capacity atleast 2 GB.

Next step was to divide memory for windows and linux according to the system capacity. I had 1TB memory so i decided to give 200MB to linux.

I did all of these and did not proceed for the next 4-5 days because i decided i'll read more about this.

After this i followed the exact steps as was given in the youtube video of how to dual boot ubuntu and windows 10 by It's FOSS - Linux Blog according to the steps i had to first preview ubuntu and then finally download and dual boot it.

I followed the steps and finally downloaded Ubuntu.
