# Why must you choose me?

I am a person who has always been fascinated by coding and the moment when you run a code and it compiles without error is the best kind of feeling. I procrastinate a lot but when i put my mind to do a task i will give my 100% and try to get the best outcome possible. The reason i want to get into amFOSS is to get the best mentorship available at campus so i can learn from the best and put my learnings to greater use. You should consider choosing me because maybe in the future i can by a good mentee too and because i am willing to learn a lot from the senior amFOSS members.

# What is my plan for the next 6 months?

I plan to work on my skills, learn new things, take part in projects and/or competitions.

# How would i contribute back to the club?

I would love to give back to the club by representing amFOSS in competitions and projects. I would also like to provide mentorship to my juniors in the future so that i can share what i learn from here and continue the legacy.

# Do I have any feedback for the selection process?

The tasks were easier than last year is what i felt but they were still not simple enough to learn and complete in 1-1.5 month's time if a person has no prior knowledge of coding.
